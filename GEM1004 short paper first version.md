#### THE TOPIC

###### Consider two circles: the family, the nation. Both of these units sound pretty good but can be highly problematic. (Just ask Euthyphro about his dad, if you don’t believe me that family relations can get problematic. Just look at the history of war to get an idea about how the nation state has not always been a pure engine of human welfare.) This being the way of it, some people have argued for the outright elimination of one or the other of these circles, or both, at least ideally. Ideally, we shouldn’t have separate families. Ideally, there shouldn’t be separate nations. (Of course, it’s consistent with this to say: realistically, we are stuck with both for the foreseeable future. But if anyone asks us how things should be, ideally, we say: erase this stuff. We won’t pretend it’s ideal to organize human life into circles that cause more trouble than they are worth, just because we can’t eliminate them, in practice.)

#### 1) Pick one of these circles, either the family or the nation.

#### 2) Make the most compelling argument you can for its elimination, ideally. (HINT: what problems does this thing cause that cannot be eliminated, so long as this thing continues to be? That’s got to be central to your argument, I’ll bet.)

#### 3) Assess how compelling your argument is. (What is the most devastating counter-argument? What values would be lost, if this thing ceases to be?)

Nations are big social groups. Big social groups have a larger propensity towards conflict. Also, bigger isn’t necessarily better. However having a large number of people united can allow for great advances in technology, for example the space race.

In modern history nothing has caused as much destruction as conflict between nations. (cite WWI and WWII as examples)
People are necessary for groups, not vice versa – groups exist to serve people
In the end groups don’t matter, people do. If groups don’t serve people then it should be done away with. But that doesn’t mean that groups cannot be used as a means towards a good end.

- Dunbar's Number: since the largest number of stable social relationships a person can have at any one time is between 100-230, it doesn't make sense for us to hold onto the nation-group, which typically spans millions - even over a billion, in the case of China and India.
- What good do groups give? Stable social relationships. Human are social beings and need stabile social relationships in order to thrive.
- Dunbar’s number suggest the largest number is 100-230. However you might feel alienated as the world is much larger than 230. Walking around in a shopping mall you might find yourself unable to connect to the passers-by.
- Evidence for such groups to thrive in our urban society? – perhaps small enterprises? Communities?
>For workers in smaller companies, Dunbar says, that problem is often solved for them. In companies smaller than 500 people, his research has shown, "there's a very strong tendency for colleagues also to be your friends."

- Intentional communities/communes – how successful have they been?

- Nation-states are alienating structures – “misfired” social instinct? Makes you do stupid shit for people you don’t know.
- Group identity is destructive
- , examples being where the group supplants an individual's moral compass,. (experiments in conformity Solomon Asch study) This is how you get rioting and armies and such.
Promotes arbitrary hostility
> In the case of S. vs. Sibisi and Others (1989) eight members of the South African Railways and Harbours Workers' Union were involved in the murder of four workers who chose not to join in the SARHWU strike. Psychologists Scott Fraser and Andrew Colman presented evidence for the defense using research from social psychology. Social anthropologist, Boet Kotzé provided evidence for the defense as well. He testified that African cultures are characterized by a collective consciousness. Kotzé testified that the collective conscious contributed to the defendants' willingness to act with the group rather than act as individuals. Fraser and Colman stated that bystander apathy, deindividuation, conformity and group polarization were extenuating factors in the killing of the four strike breakers. They explained that Deindividuation may affect group members' ability to realize that they are still accountable for their individual actions even when with a group.

- Having a large social group makes it easier for deindividuation and for one to no longer take into account one’s own identity and follow group norms (cite), which can result in people engaging in extreme behaviour. Furthermore nation is a weak identity; it is the one we are in the least proximity to. One of the weakest group types (category).

- Plato suggested that the ideal size of a democracy is 5,040. (http://www.persee.fr/doc/pop_1634-2941_2002_num_57_2_18391)
- Rousseau: the larger the number of citizens, the smaller the average citizen’s share of the decision. The representation of each citizen becomes diluted and start to feel insignificant.

- Larger group leads to smaller singular voice, less checks and balances
>“The diffusion of responsibility for alleged war crimes during World War II was famously used as a legal defense by many of the Nazis being tried at Nuremberg. A similar defense was mounted by the defendants accused in the My Lai massacre.”

- Bigger social groups can cause problems for the individual
>Latane and Darley (1968) staged an emergency using Columbia University students. The students were placed in a room—either alone, with two strangers or with three strangers to complete a questionnaire while they waited for the experimenter to return. While they were completing the questionnaire smoke was pumped into the room through a wall vent to simulate an emergency. When students were working alone they noticed the smoke almost immediately (within 5 seconds). However, students that were working in groups took longer (up to 20 seconds) to notice the smoke. Latané and Darley claimed this phenomenon could be explained by the social norm of what is considered polite etiquette in public. In most western cultures, politeness dictates that it is inappropriate to idly look around. This may indicate that a person is nosy or rude. As a result, passers-by are more likely to be keeping their attention to themselves when around large groups than when alone. People who are alone are more likely to be conscious of their surroundings and therefore more likely to notice a person in need of assistance.” “According to the principle of social influence, bystanders monitor the reactions of other people in an emergency situation to see if others think that it is necessary to intervene. If it is determined that others are not reacting to the situation, bystanders will interpret the situation as not an emergency and will not intervene. This is an example of pluralistic ignorance or social proof. Referring to the smoke experiment, even though students in the groups had clearly noticed the smoke which had become so thick that it was obscuring their vision, irritating their eyes or causing them to cough, they were still unlikely to report it.”
“Stanley Milgram, who hypothesized that the bystanders′ callous behavior was caused by the strategies they had adopted in daily life to cope with information overload. This idea has been supported to varying degrees by empirical research.  
(Christensen, K. & Levinson, D. (2003). Encyclopedia of community: From the village to the virtual world, Band 1, p. 662.)

>“According to Rutkowski et al., the social responsibility norm affects helping behavior. The norm of social responsibility states that "people should help others who are in need of help and who are dependent on them for it". As suggested by the research, the more cohesive a group, the more likely the group will act in accordance to the social responsibility norm.”
“Darley and Latané (1968) conducted research on diffusion of responsibility
(Darley, J.M.; Latané, B. (1968). "Bystander intervention in emergencies: diffusion of responsibility". Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 8 (4): 377–383.)
The findings suggest that, in the case of an emergency, when people believe that there are other people around they are less likely or slower to help a victim because they believe someone else will take responsibility. People may also fail to take responsibility for a situation depending on the context. They may assume that other bystanders are more qualified to help, such as doctors or police officers, and that their intervention would be unneeded. They may also be afraid of being superseded by a superior helper, offering unwanted assistance, or facing the legal consequences of offering inferior and possibly dangerous assistance. For this reason, some legislations limit liability for those attempting to provide medical services and non-medical services in an emergency.”

- significance of nationalism to cause conflicts on a huge scale
  - e.g. WWI and WWII

>The term “nationalism” comes from the term “nation,” which has a different meaning in current politics. Currently, the nations of the world are political constructions made of borders, legal systems and economies, called “nation-states.” These are not compatible with the view of nation that was common in history up until the last century:

>The term “nationalism” is generally used to describe two phenomena: (1) the attitude that the members of a nation have when they care about their national identity and (2) the actions that the members of a nation take when seeking to achieve (or sustain) self-determination. (1) raises questions about the concept of nation (or national identity), which is often defined in terms of common origin, ethnicity, or cultural ties, and while an individual’s membership in a nation is often regarded as involuntary, it is sometimes regarded as voluntary. – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, “Nationalism”

>Anthony Smith notes that "the prevailing image of nationalism in the West today is mainly negative," and Boyd Shafer states his "belief that nationalism, especially when carried to extremes, leads to war and destruction." Smith, Theories of Nationalism, p. 8; Boyd C. Shafer, Faces of Nationalism (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1972), p. xiii.

>Group identity is what results in an us. And with us comes them. The human brain sees them as a faceless mass, easy to abuse and treat poorly. Group identity has been shown to skew individual identity, examples being where the group supplants an individual's moral compass, and at times can even convince individuals to deny their own experience of reality. After all, how could everyone else in the group be wrong? Then we have the bystander effect, where humans leave their kin to die, assuming "somebody else will do it." It is another function of the us.
All of these were useful traits back when we were just disparate tribes fighting over hunting and foraging lands. We needed to be able to kill our competition without remorse. We needed social cohesion. We couldn't have everybody risking their lives to save the idiot kid who got himself stuck in the tar pit.
Humans aren't like this by accident. We're monsters because it was effective. And now, in different circumstances, those same traits can get us killed.
We could exist without these traits, hypothetically. People could still organize in a hierarchical system, united by a goal, and not have a concept of "us." There would instead be a group of individuals and their objective, a collaboration.
Nationalism can be productive or destructive. With some tweaks to our cognition, we could even have nationalism without it being a barrier to collaboration. Being proud of one's heritage does not preclude working with your neighbor.

- Humans are capable of living in large, complex social structures, but that comes at the cost of more restrictive rules, laws and norms to maintain a stable, cohesive group
(e.g. samaritan laws).

- The unity that the nation-group gives allows us to accomplish amazing feats of technology. Loyalty and devotion to one's nation can be a big motivating factor for the betterment of people, be it in technology, socially, education, etc.
E.g. space race

- The nation is one of the easier ways to provide a group identity
>Nationalism cuts back on a lot of stupid superficial issues. Humans love to leap to appearance and discriminate. Nationalism expands the group identity to include all citizens. It encourages people to help and support one another, not because they're poor, marginalized, or any good reason, but because they're one of us and they need help.
