#### THE TOPIC

###### Consider two circles: the family, the nation. Both of these units sound pretty good but can be highly problematic. (Just ask Euthyphro about his dad, if you don’t believe me that family relations can get problematic. Just look at the history of war to get an idea about how the nation state has not always been a pure engine of human welfare.) This being the way of it, some people have argued for the outright elimination of one or the other of these circles, or both, at least ideally. Ideally, we shouldn’t have separate families. Ideally, there shouldn’t be separate nations. (Of course, it’s consistent with this to say: realistically, we are stuck with both for the foreseeable future. But if anyone asks us how things should be, ideally, we say: erase this stuff. We won’t pretend it’s ideal to organize human life into circles that cause more trouble than they are worth, just because we can’t eliminate them, in practice.)

#### 1) Pick one of these circles, either the family or the nation.

#### 2) Make the most compelling argument you can for its elimination, ideally. (HINT: what problems does this thing cause that cannot be eliminated, so long as this thing continues to be? That’s got to be central to your argument, I’ll bet.)

IF family:
+ Dunbar's Number
-

IF nation:
- problems that nationalism cause for the individual
- significance of nationalism to cause conflicts on a huge scale
  - e.g. WWI and WWII
- types of nationalism:
  - religious nationalism
  - economic nationalism

>The term “nationalism” comes from the term “nation,” which has a different meaning in current politics. Currently, the nations of the world are political constructions made of borders, legal systems and economies, called “nation-states.” These are not compatible with the view of nation that was common in history up until the last century:

>The term “nationalism” is generally used to describe two phenomena: (1) the attitude that the members of a nation have when they care about their national identity and (2) the actions that the members of a nation take when seeking to achieve (or sustain) self-determination. (1) raises questions about the concept of nation (or national identity), which is often defined in terms of common origin, ethnicity, or cultural ties, and while an individual’s membership in a nation is often regarded as involuntary, it is sometimes regarded as voluntary. – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, “Nationalism”

#### 3) Assess how compelling your argument is. (What is the most devastating counter-argument? What values would be lost, if this thing ceases to be?)
- failure of communism?
- (is it that bad to be a cosmopolitan, or a citizen of the world)


Nationalism, as others have already pointed out, can be productive and destructive. It is a bunch of people coming together to accomplish something, for better or ill. So why define nationalism by its negatives rather than its positives?
I think that what you are trying to get at here is that group identity is necessarily destructive. Which I agree with. I think group identity is the single most dangerous human trait, and it will get us killed soon if we don't work to change it.
Group identity is what results in an us. And with us comes them. The human brain sees them as a faceless mass, easy to abuse and treat poorly. Group identity has been shown to skew individual identity, examples being where the group supplants an individual's moral compass, and at times can even convince individuals to deny their own experience of reality. After all, how could everyone else in the group be wrong? Then we have the bystander effect, where humans leave their kin to die, assuming "somebody else will do it." It is another function of the us.
All of these were useful traits back when we were just disparate tribes fighting over hunting and foraging lands. We needed to be able to kill our competition without remorse. We needed social cohesion. We couldn't have everybody risking their lives to save the idiot kid who got himself stuck in the tar pit.
Humans aren't like this by accident. We're monsters because it was effective. And now, in different circumstances, those same traits can get us killed.
We could exist without these traits, hypothetically. People could still organize in a hierarchical system, united by a goal, and not have a concept of "us." There would instead be a group of individuals and their objective, a collaboration. Us, and all the destructive behaviors that follow it, does not arrive out of a function of groups, but a function of humans.
So when you say that nationalism is destructive, I think that's not inherently so. Nationalism can be productive or destructive. With some tweaks to our cognition, we could even have nationalism without it being a barrier to collaboration. Being proud of one's heritage does not preclude working with your neighbor.
But group identity is destructive. And so long has humans hold these traits, nationalism will have destructive consequences. So if you hold the assumption that group identity is destructive (which it would seem you do) then saying nationalism is destructive is really just a truism, because nationalism is an expression of group identity. But again, it doesn't have to be. If we examine the old quote "love of money is the root of all evil," it isn't money that's the problem here. It's love. The destructive practices you hold nationalism accountable for are in reality just symptoms of a deeper illness. One we desperately need to address.

Honestly, I would consider nationalism in moderation to be a temporary treatment for this behavior. Humans aren't stupid, but the human brain is. Subtle distinction. Humans unwittingly fall into traps laid by their neurology. The intelligent, rational portion of their mind is fooled and undermined by the reptilian portion of their brain, without them even realizing it. Not really anybody's fault.
Nationalism cuts back on a lot of stupid superficial issues. Humans love to leap to appearance and discriminate. Nationalism expands the group identity to include all citizens. It encourages people to help and support one another, not because they're poor, marginalized, or any good reason, but because they're one of us and they need help. People don't care if somebody is poor and looking for help. They don't care if somebody is marginalized and looking for help. But if somebody in their group is suffering? Much more inclined to pitch in. It's just how humans are.
Here's a bolder thesis that I've crafted.
Identity politics will only exacerbate all the negative human tendencies by celebrating and pushing destructive group identity. Look at the US and Europe now. I can't personally think of social and economic division this wide since the late 1800's and early 1900's. A time when communists, anarchists, fascists, and capitalists actually fought each other in the streets. The middle class is dying. People are at each others throats over social and economic issues. Racial tensions are running hot.
The technological singularity could solve all of our problems. And it is close. So close I can taste it.
With the power to rewire the human mind and become something better, we would no longer have to be defined by our negative traits. We're free to be what we want to be. We could undo the bugs, fix the glitches, and make the human intelligence the rational and fully aware entity that we erroneously perceive it to be. But we can't (collectively) reach that height if we suffer tremendous social upheaval and economic downturn. Science requires stability - for funding, for clear communication of ideas and information, and for new blood to enter the field.
If history, statistics, and our current situation is any evidence, division causes instability. To reach the end game of civilization, we need unity, or as close to it as we can get. The closest we can get, realistically, is nationalism. Once we reach the end game, we will have the power and resources to fix the cognitive biases that would otherwise lead to our downfall. But if we let them get the best of us now, we may never get that chance.

My only caveat is that when you speak of tremendous social upheaval and economic downturn, historically nothing has created as much as war between nations. That is the one biggest risk I see with nationalism. As long as nations remain at peace with one another, I think we'll be fine. But every 100 years there tends to be a big war, and I think we have to be very vigilant that it does not happen in this century because with the destructiveness of modern weapons it would be catastrophic.

That is true. We've already had several near misses. But while I'm one to rely on historical precedent, I have to concede that W.M.D's are unprecedented. They've radically shifted how we engage in war and diplomacy. While the human behavioral patterns which lead to the war cycle may not change, WMD's have certainly forced us to examine our behavior (and the behavior of others) much more critically. Hopefully this higher level of awareness will break the cycle, or at least stave off the next phase. But to make sure that happens, we have to be observant, as you said.
So yes, I agree with you. But we do need to be careful about our estimations for conflict, because we are treading uncharted territory here. I would suggest assuming the worst, but that could actually be bad advice which might lead to some miscalculation or misinterpretation somewhere down the line. Cautious vigilance is probably the most we can hope to do as ordinary citizens.
